Main Function

Because the complexity of the zig zag traverse,
occurs on the perimeter of the matrix,
we need to be able to identify,
when our pointer is on the perimeter,
during the traverse

Also, it is important to understand,
that wee need to keep track of,
the direction,
up or down,
that we are currently traversing in.




Input(matrix): array

height = len(array) - 1
width = len(array[0]) - 1
# since we need to know when are at the perimeter,
# of the matrix, and since the size of the,
# matrix will not change.
# we can just create two varaible,
# to store that information

result = []
# as we traverse in a zigzag order,
# we need to append each value at each index,
# to an output array,
# as requested by the problem statement

row = 0
col = 0
going_down = True
going_up = False
# to keep track of,
# where our pointer current is,
# and
# where our pointer is heading to next,
# in the traverse,
# we can create three variables,
# row, col, going_down
#
# the starting point of our,
# zigzag traverse will be,
# the 1st element in the matrix,
# or the 0th, 0th postion,
# and due this,
# the first direction of the traverse,
# will always be down

while not isOutOfBounds(row, col, height, width):
# to traverse in any order,
# let alone zigzag order
# we need our pointer to move,
# because of this,
# we will be incrementing and decrementing,
# row and col,
# which will move our pointer
#
# because the input size,
# of our matrix,
# will change,
# upon different inputs,
# we need to continue to move our pointer,
    # incrementing and decrementing,
    # row and col
# until we reach out of bounds,
# of the size of the matrix
#
# on each iteration of this while loop,
# the isOutOfBounds function will be called,
# and the isOutOfBounds function will,
# return True,
    # if our pointer,
    # row and col,
    # is out of bounds
# or
# return False
    # if our pointer,
    # row and col,
    # is out of bounds
#
# since we have not,
# in front of the function call,
# the while loop we break,
# if the pointer, row and col,
# is out of bounds,
# and
# continue to loop,
# while pointer, row and col,
# is in the bounds of the matrix

    results.append(array[row][col])
    # at this point,
    # we know that our pointer,
    # is in the bounds,
    # of the matrix
    #
    # so, we need to append the value,
    # of our current index,
    # to the output array


    # now, we need to move our pointer,
    # to the next zigzag order idx

    # it's important to understand,
    # where the pointer needs to,
    # "turned around"
    # during a zig zag traverse
        # the pointer needs to
        # "turned around" if either,
        # the pointer is at the,
        # left edge or bottom edge
        # or
        # the pointer is at the,
        # right edge or top edge

    # to help us make the decison
    # on where to move the pointer to,
    # we can reference,
    # the direction variables,
    # going_down and going_up
    # that we created
    #

    if going_down:
        if col == 0 or row == height:

        # if we are going DOWN
        # and we need to "turn around"
            # pointer is at the
            # left edge or bottom edge
        # we need to update,
        # going_down to False,
        # and
        # going_up to True,
            # because we are turning around
        # and
        # we need to move our pointer,
            # increment row OR col
        # we increment col,
        # if row == col
            # move our pointer,
                # to the right
            # because,
            # we have finished our traverse,
            # and we need to push,
            # the idx out of bounds,
            # to exit the while loop
        # we increment row,
        # if col == 0 and row != height
            # move our pointer,
                # down
            # because, we to
            # traverse unvisited idxs,
            # and the next diagonal,
            # to traverse,
            # would be the diagonal,
            # below it

        # if we are going DOWN
        # and we do NOT need to
        # "turn around"
            # pointer is NOT at the,
            # left edge or bottom edge

        # then we should continue,
        # going
        # digonally down
        # we can continue,
        # going digonally down,
        # by incremeting row
            # down
        # and decreming col
            # left

    if going_up:

        # if we are going DOWN

                # pointer is at the

            # increment row if,
            # col == width
                # move our pointer,
                    # down
                # because, we to
                # traverse unvisited idxs,
                # and the next diagonal,
                # to traverse,
                # would be the diagonal,
                # below it


            # increment col if,
            # row == 0 and col != width
                # move our pointer,
                    # right
                # because, we to
                # traverse unvisited idxs,
                # and the next diagonal,
                # to traverse,
                # would be the diagonal,
                # to the right

        # if we are going UP
        # and we do NOT need to
        # "turn around"
            # pointer is NOT at the,
            # top edge or right edge

        # then we should continue,
        # going
        # digonally up
        #
        # we can continue,
        # going digonally up,
        # by decremeting row
            # up
        # and incremeting col
            # right

return result
at this point, we have finished,
our traverse of the 2D array,
and we have appendx each idxs value,
to our output array in zigzag order
